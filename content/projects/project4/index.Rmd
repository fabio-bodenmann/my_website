# Trump's Approval Margins

Trump's average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. 

```{r average_rating}

weeks <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(week = cut.Date(enddate, breaks = "1 week", labels = FALSE, start.on.monday=0))


graph_weeks <-  weeks %>% group_by(week) %>%

Splitting up by year:

```{r trump_margins, out.width="100%"}
year_faceted <- weeks %>% mutate(facet_year = year(enddate)) %>% group_by(week) %>%
  summarise(net_approval = mean(adjusted_approve) - mean(adjusted_disapprove), facet_year=mean(facet_year)) %>%
  mutate(week=week%%52) %>%
  filter(facet_year == 2017 |facet_year == 2018 |facet_year == 2019 |facet_year == 2020) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=week, y=net_approval, group=1)) +

  facet_wrap(~facet_year) +

Comparing Confidence Intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020)

```{r condifence intervals, out.width="100%"}
ci_week_15 <- weeks %>% 
  filter(week == "15") %>% 
  summarise(mean_week_15 = mean(adjusted_approve)-mean(adjusted_disapprove),sd_week_15 = sd(adjusted_approve-adjusted_disapprove), count = n(), t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), se = sqrt(( (sd(adjusted_approve)^2/count)+(sd(adjusted_disapprove)^2/count))), margin_of_error = t_critical * se, ci_low = mean_week_15 - margin_of_error, ci_high = mean_week_15 + margin_of_error)

formattable(ci_week_15)

ci_week_34 <- weeks %>% 
 filter(week == "34") %>% 
  summarise(mean_week_34 = mean(adjusted_approve)-mean(adjusted_disapprove),sd_week_34 = sd(adjusted_approve-adjusted_disapprove), count = n(), t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), se = sqrt(( (sd(adjusted_approve)^2/count)+(sd(adjusted_disapprove)^2/count))), margin_of_error = t_critical * se, ci_low = mean_week_34 - margin_of_error, ci_high = mean_week_34 + margin_of_error)

formattable(ci_week_34)

```

Explanation: The Confidence Intervals between week 15 and week 34 show a marked decrease in the approval rating of close to 8% both in terms of high and low, showing an overall marked worsening in terms of popular perception of President Trump's work. A possible explanation would be that in the 200 weeks between the two periods under consideration a series of interventions, executive orders and public statements have made the President increasingly unpopular, a hypehtisis shown by the previous graphs that show a constant downward trend in ratings.
