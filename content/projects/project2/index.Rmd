# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

```{r load-movies-data, echo=FALSE}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("content/projects/project2/data", "movies.csv")) #import the dataset
```
Who has got the upper hand on IMDb ratings? On average, Spielberg's movies achieve a rating of 7.57, while Burton's movies achieve a rating of 6.93. However, there is some overlap in the 95% confidence interval for their ratings. See the chart below for a visualization. 

```{r}
spielberg_burton_movies<-movies%>%
  
  filter(director=="Tim Burton"|director=="Steven Spielberg")%>% #filter by director called Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg
  
  group_by(director)%>% #group by director
  
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE), #calculate mean value
            sd_rating = sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE), #calculate standard deviation
            count = n(), #count the number
            se_rating = sd_rating/sqrt(count), #calculate standard error
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), #calculate t-statistics
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rating, #calculate margin of error
            lower = mean_rating - t_critical * se_rating, #calculate the lower part of CI
            upper = mean_rating + t_critical * se_rating) #calculate the upper part of CI

lower_boundary<-as.numeric(spielberg_burton_movies[1,8])

upper_boundary<-as.numeric(spielberg_burton_movies[2,9])

ggplot(spielberg_burton_movies, aes(x = mean_rating, y =reorder(director,mean_rating)))+ #draw a new ggplot
  
  geom_point(aes(color=director,fill=director),size=4,shape=21) + #draw the point value colored and filled by director
  
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmax =lower, xmin = upper,color=director),width=0.1,size=1)+ #draw the error bar 
  
  labs(title="Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?",subtitle="95% confidence intervals overlap",x="Mean IMDb Rating",y="")+ #add labs
  
  theme_bw()+ #set the theme
  
  geom_text(aes(label=format(mean_rating,digits=3,format="f")),vjust=-0.7,size=5)+ #add data label
  
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = lower_boundary, xmax = upper_boundary,ymin = -Inf, ymax = +Inf), fill = "#D3D3D3", alpha = 0.3)+ #add the overlapped part
  
  theme(legend.position = "none")+ #hide the legend
  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold")) #bold the main title
```

In order to be 100% sure, we can look at some statistical information before we crown the king of IMDb.

```{r}
director_ratings<-movies%>%
  
  filter(director=="Tim Burton"|director=="Steven Spielberg")%>% #filter by director called Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg
  
  group_by(director)%>%  #group by director
  
  select(director, rating) #select director and rating 

t.test(rating ~ director, data = director_ratings) #use t.test() to calculate

obs_diff_director <- director_ratings %>%
  
  specify(rating ~ director) %>% #use specify() to associate rating and director
  
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) #calculate difference in means

null_dist_director <- director_ratings%>% 
  
  specify(rating ~ director) %>% #use specify() to associate rating and director
  
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% #repeat 1000 times
  
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) #calculate difference in means

null_dist_director %>% visualize() +
  
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_director, direction = "two-sided") #shape p_value

null_dist_director %>%
  
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_director, direction = "two_sided") #get p_value

```


Null hypothesis: The difference of the mean ratings of Spielberg and Burton is equal to 0.

Alternative hypothesis: The difference of the mean ratings of Spielberg and Burton is not equal to 0.

Conclusion: Based on both the t.test and the infer command, there seems to be a statistically significant difference in the mean ratings of Spielberg and Burton based on a 0.014 p-value using the infer command and a 0.01 p-value using the t.test command. Therefore we reject the null hypothesis.

Hence, the Spielberg wins the battle over IMDb ratings.
